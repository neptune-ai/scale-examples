# Migrating from W&B to Neptune

This script allows you to copy run metadata from W&B to Neptune.

## Prerequisites
- A Weights and Biases account, `wandb` library installed, and environment variables set.
- A Neptune account, `neptune-scale` Python library installed, and environment variables set. For details, see the [docs][docs-setup].

## Instructions

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Run `wandb_to_neptune.py`.
1. Enter the source W&B entity name. Leave blank to use your default entity.
1. Enter the destination Neptune workspace name. Leave blank to read from the `NEPTUNE_PROJECT` environment variable.
1. Enter the number of workers to use to copy the metadata. Leave blank to select the   number of workers automatically.
1. Enter the W&B projects you want to export as comma-separated values. Leave blank to export all projects.
1. The script will generate run logs in the working directory. You can change the directory with `logging.basicConfig()`. Live progress bars will also be rendered in the console.
1. Neptune projects corresponding to the W&B projects will be created with [*private*][docs-project-access] visibility if they don't exist. You can change the visibility later from the WebApp once the project has been created, or by updating the `create_project()` function in `copy_project()`.
1. The project description will be set as *Exported from <W&B project URL>*. You can change the description later from the WebApp once the project has been created, or by updating the `create_project()` function in `copy_project()`.

## Metadata mapping from W&B to Neptune

| Metadata | W&B | Neptune |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Project name | example_project | example-project<sup>1</sup> |
| Project URL | project.url | Project description |
| Run name | run.name | run.sys.name |
| Run ID | run.id | run.sys.custom_run_id<sup>2</sup> |
| Notes | run.notes | run.sys.description |
| Tags | run.tags | run.sys.tags |
| Group | run.group | run.sys.group_tags |
| Config | run.config | run.config<sup>3</sup> |
| Run summary | run.summary | run.summary<sup>3</sup> |
| Run metrics | run.scan_history() | run.<METRIC_NAME><sup>4</sup> |
| System metrics | run.history(stream="system") | run.system.<METRIC_NAME><sup>5</sup> |
| All W&B attributes | run.* | run.wandb.* |

<sup>1</sup> Underscores `_` in a W&B project name are replaced by a hyphen `-` in Neptune  
<sup>2</sup> Passing the wandb.run.id as neptune.run.custom_run_id ensures that duplicate Neptune runs are not created for the same W&B run even if the script is run multiple times  
<sup>3</sup> Values are converted to a string in Neptune  
<sup>4</sup> `_step` and `_timestamp` associated with a metric are logged as `step` and `timestamp` respectively with a Neptune metric  
<sup>5</sup> `system.` prefix is removed when logging to Neptune

## What is not exported
- Project-level metadata
- All files (artifacts, source code, requirements.txt, images, etc.)
- Models
- W&B specific objects and data types
- Forking details
- `run.summary` keys starting with `_`†
- Metrics and W&B attributes starting with `_`†

† These have been excluded at the code level to prevent redundancy and noise, but can be included.

## Post-migration
* W&B Workspace views can be recreated using Neptune's [overlaid charts][docs-charts] and [reports][docs-reports]
* W&B Runs table views can be recreated using Neptune's [custom views][docs-custom-views]
